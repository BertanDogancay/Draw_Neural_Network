# Draw_Neural_Network
Experience the inner workings of a neural network with this SFML simulation. Have you ever wondered how a neural network adjusts its values and weights during training? Look no further than this simulation, which provides a fascinating and intuitive way to explore the process. Get an up-close look at how data is processed and see how the network responds to training inputs. This simulation is a valuable tool for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of neural networks and the way they learn.
You can change the number of inputs/outputs or the number of hidden layers and the number of neurans in each hidden layer.

## Requirements:
* SFML 2.5.1
* VS 2022

### NOTE: It looks better if you run it on your device.

This neural network consists of 4 inputs and 1 output, and it has been used to simulate a 16-combination Karnaugh map with highly accurate results. In this visualization, weights are color-coded to indicate whether they are below or above the median weight value. Orange is used to represent weights below the median, while blue indicates weights above the median. Additionally, the intensity of the color reflects the magnitude of the difference between the weight and the median value. This approach allows for a quick and intuitive understanding of the distribution of weights and highlights the weights that are most different from the median, potentially revealing interesting patterns or outliers. What's remarkable about this neural network is its versatility, as it can be trained to perform a wide variety of tasks as long as there is input/output data provided. I have personally implemented this neural network in a Flappy Bird game, where it is trained through reinforcement learning while the game is running.
