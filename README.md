### NOTE: It looks better if you run it on your device.

This neural network consists of 4 inputs and 1 output, and it has been used to simulate a 16-combination Karnaugh map with highly accurate results. What's remarkable about this neural network is its versatility, as it can be trained to perform a wide variety of tasks as long as there is input/output data provided. I have personally implemented this neural network in a Flappy Bird game, where it is trained through reinforcement learning while the game is running.
